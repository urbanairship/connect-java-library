2016-06-06: Release 3.0.0

	Caught an error where push and group identifiers would not be set on
	push body events. Push ids are also optional on many events, so they
	were changed to Guava Optionals on associated pushes, which is the
	breaking change requiring the major version bump.

2016-06-02: Release 2.2.4

	Caught an error where device info attributes and identifiers were
	reversed.

	Skipping a few patch versions due to churn while we figured out some
	internal distribution logic.

2016-05-23: Released 2.2.1

	Screen View were not parsing properly, in app message expiration events
	would not serialize back to JSON properly.

2016-05-11: Released 2.2.0

	Screen View are now supported in the client. Also adds session_ids to
	the events for custom events and in app messages.

2016-03-10: Released 2.1.0

        Adds support for device attributes,  app-defined identifiers, and a
        new event type. The new event type, Control events, are not yet defined
        in the official documentation.

2016-02-17: Released 2.0.0

	Removed unused fields from Custom Event model objects, and switched
	one of the fields from String to Optional<String>. This will break any
	code relying on the Custom Event model object, hence the major version
	bump.
